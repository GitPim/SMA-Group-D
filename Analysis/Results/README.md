An explanation for the different runs:

#MWG_runs:
- run 1-3: wrongfully has the sun in the centre of the milky way potential, causing too much comets to stay bound
- run 4-6: has the sun at the correct distance from the centre, but breaks down after about ~10^7 years by ejecting some of the giant planets from the solarsystem

#Vanilla_runs:
- run 1-3: only has the final timesteps, unclear why
- run 4-6: has all timesteps, but again breaks down after some 10^7 years
