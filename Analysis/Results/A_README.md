An explanation for the different runs:

#MWG_runs:
- run 1-3: wrongfully has the sun in the centre of the milky way potential, causing too much comets to stay bound (solver = Huayno)
- run 4-6: has the sun at the correct distance from the centre, but breaks down after about ~10^7 years by ejecting some of the giant planets from the solarsystem (solver = Huayno)
- run 7-9: runs for only 10 Myr and saves every 0.5 Myr (solver = Huayno)

#Vanilla_runs:
- run 1-3: only has the final timesteps, unclear why (solver = Huayno)
- run 4-6: has all timesteps, but again breaks down after some 10^7 years (solver = Huayno)
- run 7-9: (solver = Mercury)
- run 10-12: runs for only 10 Myr and saves every 0.5 Myr (solver = Huayno)
- run 13-15: (Nu niet hedendaags zonnestelsel, maar post tack zonnestelsel orbits with non zero inclination. Stable up to 45 Myr. solver = Mercury)

#Vanilla_tack_runs:
- run 1-3: First succesfull tack run over 100 Myr, including close ups near the tack (solver = Mercury)
- run 4-6: Test runs om de stabiliteit van Tack te testen, beiden instabiele planeten (solver = Mercury)
